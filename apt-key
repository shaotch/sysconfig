This file is saying how fixed the GPG errors like:
    W: GPG error: http://archive precise Release: The following signatures couldn't
    be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY C2518248EEA14886'

The fix is:
    sudo apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys C2518248EEA14886

And then:
    sudo apt-get update
