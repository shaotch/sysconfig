At present, there are two ways to get this fixed:

(1) Modify /etc/default/locale
    LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
    LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8:"
    This way is really good, no side effect with this change.


(2) Add the following to /etc/environment

    LC_CTYPE="zh_CN.UTF-8
    **It will change you terminal output to Chinese.
