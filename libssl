Lets make sure that you have your SSL installed and updated:

sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl1.0.0 libssl-dev
Now lets fix the naming of the file by creating a link:

cd /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu
sudo ln -s libssl.so.1.0.0 libssl.so.10
sudo ln -s libcrypto.so.1.0.0 libcrypto.so.10
And finally, lets inform the developer about this flaw so he can fix it :)
