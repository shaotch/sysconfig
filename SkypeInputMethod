At present, there are two ways to get this fixed:

(1) Modify /etc/default/locale
    LANG="en_US.UTF-8"
    LANGUAGE="en_US.UTF-8:"
    This way is really good, no side effect with this change.

    * another case :
        Chinese IME cannot be actived maybe casued by the absence of libs:
            fcitx-libs
            fcitx-libs-qt
            fcitx-libs-qt5


(2) Add the following to /etc/environment

    LC_CTYPE="zh_CN.UTF-8
    **It will change you terminal output to Chinese.

(3) To have Skype Tray Icon displayed in Ubuntu, install sni-qt package:

    sudo apt-get install sni-qt:i386
